## 1. Query Rewrite

Check if your current query can be rewritten to be more efficient. For example, you can use `JOIN` instead of subqueries, or use `EXISTS` instead of `IN`.

## 2. Indexing

Make sure you have proper indexes on the columns used in the `WHERE` clause. Indexes can significantly speed up the query performance.

## 3. Avoid `SELECT *`

Avoid using `SELECT *` in your queries. Instead, explicitly list the columns you need. This can reduce the amount of data that needs to be fetched from the database.

## 5. Limit the Result Set

If you only need a subset of the data, use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of rows returned by the query.

## 7. Query Caching

Enable query caching in your database server to cache the results of frequently executed queries. This can reduce the query execution time for subsequent requests.
