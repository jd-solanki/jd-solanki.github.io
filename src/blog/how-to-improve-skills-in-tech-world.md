# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

When starting out your tech career you might don't know where to start. There are so many things to learn and so many technologies to choose from. It's easy to get lost in all of this.

Today I explained my colleague how to improve skills & where to look for them. I shared long list of links to him but that was particular to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) technology so I'll be generic here.

I thought it might be useful for others as well so here's my tips on improving skills in tech world:

- Find high quality YouTube channels for your technology. This might be hard at first so just ask your colleagues or scan the internet for recommendations. Additionally, I also recommend checking related YouTube channels as well. For example, If you are a Vue or Python developing using VS Code, You can subscribe to VSCode's official YouTube channel as well.
- Try to find sites that posts high quality blog post. Avoid blog posts written by agency or company, They just do that for SEO and don't have technical knowledge. Instead, Find active people from your community and check if they maintain a blog.
- To learn advanced & latest stuff, Watch conference talks (You can find them on YouTube)
- Subscribing to newsletter of your technology is also a good idea. You can find latest news, blog posts, tutorials, etc. in your inbox.
- Stay up to date on what's hot by checking [Trending](https://github.com/trending) Repos in GitHub. You can narrow it down to your specific language or technology.
- Follow active people of your community or Organizations on GitHub
- Start watching repo releases on GitHub for your favorite repos to get latest updates
- Finally, Follow active & creative people of your community on Twitter. You can also follow twitter handles of tool or package you are using.

To sum up, You need to find high quality content creators and follow them on YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, etc. to improve your skills.
