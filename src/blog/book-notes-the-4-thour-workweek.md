- Don't follow a model that doesn't work. Ask, what is I did the opposite?
- Retirement is worst case scenario. aim to distribute "mini retirements" by working only when your are most effective, life will be more productive and enjoyable.
- Ask for forgiveness not for permission. Most people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitate to get in the way if you are moving
