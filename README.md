# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I'm JD Solanki.

This is the source code of my personal site [https://jd-solanki.github.io/](https://https://jd-solanki.github.io/). I'm using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) to build this site.

I use it to write about things I learn, things I do, and things I like. I hope you find something useful here. I'm from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ so you may find some references like using the Rupee (â‚¹) instead of the dollar ($) when I'm talking about money.
