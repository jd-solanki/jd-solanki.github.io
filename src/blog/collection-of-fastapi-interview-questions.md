## Q: What is FastAPI, and how does it differ from other web frameworks in Python?

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It has quickly gained popularity due to its speed, simplicity, and developer-friendly features. Some of the key features and differences from other web frameworks in FastAPI are:

- **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation automatically using the OpenAPI standard1.
- **Python Type Hints**: FastAPI uses Python-type hints for automatic data validation, improving code readability and enabling automatic validation of incoming data1.
- **Data Validation**: FastAPI uses Pydantic models for data validation1.
- **Asynchronous Support**: FastAPI fully embraces asynchronous operations, allowing you to use Pythonâ€™s async and await keywords to write asynchronous endpoints1.
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI supports dependency injection, allowing you to declare dependencies for your endpoints1.
- **Security Features**: FastAPI includes various security features out of the box, such as support for OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and automatic validation of request data1.

## Q: Explain dependency injection in FastAPI and its benefits

As the name suggest, dependency injection allow FastAPI route to declare things that is needed to run or enhance the route functionality.

Common uses of dependencies include sharing connections to databases, implementing authorization and authentication, debugging and monitoring, and injecting configuration settings.

A dependency provider is a function or class responsible for supplying dependencies to FastAPI route. FastAPI also support nested or sub dependencies.

Here are some benefits of using Dependency Injection in FastAPI:

- **Isolation of Code**: Dependencies enable the isolation of code by passing them to route, rather than instantiating them directly. This isolation enhances code reusability, maintainability, and testability.
- **Improved Code Readability**: Dependencies make code more readable by encapsulating complex logic and clearly specifying the requirements of dependent functions and classes.
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Dependencies minimize code duplication by facilitating the sharing of dependencies among different routes.
- **Facilitated Testing**: Dependencies simplify the testing of code by allowing the simulation of dependencies in tests, making it easier to verify the functionality of the code.
